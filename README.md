# Interpreter in Golang

This repository contains the implementation of an interpreter written in Golang. The interpreter follows the principles and concepts outlined in the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball. It serves as a practical guide for learning how to build an interpreter step by step.

## Contents

The interpreter implementation includes the following components:

- Lexer: Tokenizes the input source code into tokens.
- Parser: Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens.
- Evaluator: Evaluates the AST and performs the execution of the interpreted language.

## Book

To gain a deeper understanding of the interpreter implementation and the concepts involved, it is highly recommended to read the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.
